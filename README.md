## The heraldic database of the National Archives, Europeana Heraldica, has been renewed. Its website has been given a new look and new heraldic material has been added to the database. The new material includes, for example, the coats of arms of the noble families of Finland, Sweden and the Baltics, the coats of arms of the slag families and the medieval seals of Finland.
